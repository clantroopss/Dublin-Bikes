#### Sustainable City Management - Dublin Bikes

The goal of this project is to provide a decision-support tool for city managers and city service providers to optimise mobility service delivery. A dashboard implemented provides information to mobility service providers as to the current volume of usage, predicted usage for next 1 hour using machine learning, and potential areas of over- or under-use by different bike indicators on map. 

To run the application install NodeJS and make sure you have a chrome or advance browser.
